# Northcoders News API

In order to successfully create the nc_news and nc_news_test databases, please create two .env files (.env.development & .env.test) and then input the following into each:

PGDATABASE=nc_news => .env.development

PGDATABASE=nc_news_test => .env.test

After this you should be able to use 'npm run setup-dbs' and 'npm run seed' to create and populate the databases.

Any questions, give me a shout on Slack! -RR
